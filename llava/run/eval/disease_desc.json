    "fibrosis": "Fibrosis refers to excessive deposition of collagen and extracellular matrix during abnormal tissue repair after inflammation or injury, leading to the replacement of normal lung tissue with reticular or band-like high-density shadows, commonly seen in the lower and peripheral lungs. Imaging may show honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. Clinically, patients often present with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and reduced exercise tolerance.",
    "edema": "Pulmonary edema refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, usually caused by cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic factors. Imaging shows patchy or 'bat-wing' distributed heterogeneous high-density shadows in the middle or entire lung, often accompanied by Kerley lines and cardiac enlargement. Clinically, patients typically experience acute dyspnea, cough, cyanosis, and bilateral lung crackles.",
    "pneumothorax": "Pneumothorax refers to the presence of air in the pleural cavity, leading to partial or complete lung collapse. Imaging typically shows a low-density black air space along the pleura, with a clear demarcation from the normal lung tissue, along with lung collapse. In tension pneumothorax, mediastinal shift may occur. Clinically, patients often present with sudden unilateral chest pain, dyspnea, and decreased breath sounds, sometimes accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema.",
    "cardiomegaly": "Cardiomegaly refers to the enlargement of the heart due to hypertension, cardiomyopathy, or valvular disease, causing chamber dilation or wall thickening. Imaging shows significant cardiac enlargement with an expanded and smooth contour, often marked by an increased cardiothoracic ratio, potentially accompanied by pulmonary congestion and bronchial congestion. Clinically, patients may experience reduced exercise tolerance, dyspnea, lower limb edema, and arrhythmias.",
    "atelectasis": "Atelectasis refers to the collapse of part or all of the lung tissue due to airway obstruction, external thoracic pressure, or intrapulmonary pathology. Imaging shows increased local lung density, volume reduction, bronchial displacement, and visceral pleural traction, commonly affecting the lower lobes. Clinically, patients may exhibit rapid shallow breathing, localized decreased or absent breath sounds, and a history of recent surgery or inadequate airway clearance.",
    "nodule": "A lung nodule is a localized lesion with a diameter of less than 3 cm. Imaging typically shows a round or oval localized density, with either well-defined or spiculated edges. Some nodules may contain calcifications or low-density necrotic areas. Clinically, most patients are asymptomatic, but growing or malignant nodules may present with cough and hemoptysis.",
    "emphysema": "Emphysema is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by the permanent destruction of alveolar walls and airspace enlargement. Imaging shows scattered or diffuse low-density areas in both lungs, reduced lung markings, often with bullae or cystic lesions, flattened diaphragm, and hyperinflated lungs. Clinically, patients typically have a history of chronic cough, sputum production, and progressive dyspnea, often associated with smoking or long-term occupational exposure.",
    "no_finding": "No finding refers to the absence of radiographic abnormalities detected in the chest X-ray.",
    "mass": "A mass refers to an abnormal localized tissue overgrowth. Imaging shows a focal high-density lesion, which may have regular or irregular shapes with spiculated margins, often accompanied by internal necrosis, calcification, or hemorrhage. Surrounding features may include bronchial distortion or lymphadenopathy. Clinically, patients may present with cough, weight loss, or hemoptysis, requiring further pathological examination.",
    "pleural_thickening": "Pleural thickening refers to fibrotic or calcified pleural changes due to chronic inflammation, infection, or asbestos exposure. Imaging shows localized or diffuse thickening along the pleural surface, appearing as streaky or patchy high-density shadows, sometimes with nodular changes. Clinically, patients may be asymptomatic, but a history of pleuritis or exposure to harmful substances is often present.",
    "effusion": "Pleural effusion refers to the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, which may be caused by infection, heart failure, malignancy, or other inflammatory diseases. Typically seen in the lower lung fields and posterior chest cavity, imaging shows a homogeneous or layered fluid density with a clear meniscus sign, with CT revealing low-density regions. Severe effusion may cause lung compression or bronchial displacement. Clinically, patients may present with dyspnea, chest pain, and cough, with physical signs of reduced breath sounds, dull percussion, and abnormal auscultation.",
    "infiltration": "Infiltration refers to localized or diffuse high-density changes in lung tissue due to inflammation, infection, or malignancy. Imaging typically shows patchy or ill-defined high-density areas, sometimes with a ground-glass appearance or consolidation, occasionally accompanied by air bronchograms or bronchial wall thickening. Clinically, patients may present with cough, fever, dyspnea, and fatigue, often with elevated inflammatory markers.",
    "pneumonia": "Pneumonia refers to lung parenchyma inflammation caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other microorganisms, leading to alveolar filling with inflammatory exudates. Imaging shows localized or patchy consolidation with irregular margins, often accompanied by air bronchograms, pleural reaction, and mild pleural effusion. Clinically, patients present with fever, cough, sputum production, chest pain, and fatigue, with elevated white blood cell counts and inflammatory markers.",
    "hernia": "Hernia refers to the abnormal protrusion of an organ or tissue through an anatomical defect or weakened area, commonly seen in hiatal hernias. Imaging shows intra-abdominal organs abnormally positioned in the thoracic cavity, appearing as continuous soft-tissue density or gas-fluid levels, often with diaphragmatic defects or abnormalities. Clinically, patients may present with upper abdominal discomfort, acid reflux, dysphagia, or chest pain, often associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease or digestive issues.",
    "consolidation": "Consolidation refers to the complete filling of alveolar spaces with liquid, pus, blood, or cellular material, replacing the normal air content. Imaging shows homogenous, dense, well-defined opacities, often with air bronchograms and pleural reactions, sometimes with minimal pleural effusion. Clinically, patients often have fever, cough, sputum production, chest pain, and dyspnea, with significantly elevated inflammatory markers."
